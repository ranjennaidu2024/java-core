# Streams ðŸ“š
## Introduction to java.util.stream API in Java
The `java.util.stream` package in Java provides a powerful way to process collections of objects in a functional style. It was introduced in Java 8 as part of the Java Collections Framework.
### What is a Stream?
A Stream in Java represents a sequence of elements and supports different operations to perform computations on these elements. Streams allow for functional-style operations to be performed on collections of objects, such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and more.
### Features
- **Lazy Evaluation:** Streams perform operations only when necessary. Intermediate operations are typically lazy, meaning they do not compute a result until the result is needed by a terminal operation.
- **Parallel Processing:** Streams can leverage parallel processing, making it easier to write parallelizable code to take advantage of multi-core processors.
- **Functional Composition:** Streams provide methods for composing operations in a functional style, making it easy to chain multiple operations together.

### Basic Operations
- **Filtering:** Allows filtering elements based on certain criteria.
- **Mapping:** Allows transforming elements into another form.
- **Reducing:** Performs a reduction on the elements of the stream.
- **Sorting:** Sorts the elements of the stream based on a comparator.

### Example ðŸ’¡
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");

        // Filter names starting with 'A' and collect them into a new list
        List<String> filteredNames = names.stream()
                                         .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
                                         .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(filteredNames); // Output: [Alice]
    }
}
```

## Creating Stream from Collections
Streams provide a modern, functional approach to processing collections of objects in Java, allowing for concise and expressive code.

### Creating a Stream from List

You can easily create a Stream from a List using the `stream()` method introduced in Java 8.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> myList = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange");
        Stream<String> stream = myList.stream();

        // Use the stream
        stream.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
### Creating a Stream from Set
Similarly, you can create a Stream from a Set using the stream() method.

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Set<String> mySet = new HashSet<>();
        mySet.add("apple");
        mySet.add("banana");
        mySet.add("orange");

        Stream<String> stream = mySet.stream();

        // Use the stream
        stream.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
### Creating a Stream from Map
To create a Stream from a Map, you can use the keySet().stream() or values().stream() methods.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<Integer, String> myMap = new HashMap<>();
        myMap.put(1, "apple");
        myMap.put(2, "banana");
        myMap.put(3, "orange");

        Stream<Integer> keysStream = myMap.keySet().stream();
        Stream<String> valuesStream = myMap.values().stream();

        // Use the streams
        keysStream.forEach(System.out::println);
        valuesStream.forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```
### Conclusion ðŸŽ‰
Creating Streams from collections in Java is straightforward and allows for concise and expressive code. Streams provide powerful features for processing data in a functional style.

## Streams have no Storage
Streams in Java are not data storage containers; instead, they provide a way to process elements from a source (such as a collection, array, or I/O channel) in a functional and declarative style. Streams operate on data elements in a sequence and allow for various operations to be performed on those elements, such as filtering, mapping, sorting, and reducing.

### Example ðŸ’¡
Consider the following example that demonstrates the use of streams to process a list of integers:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

        // Example 1: Filtering even numbers
        numbers.stream()
               .filter(num -> num % 2 == 0)
               .forEach(System.out::println);

        // Example 2: Mapping numbers to their squares
        numbers.stream()
               .map(num -> num * num)
               .forEach(System.out::println);

        // Example 3: Reducing numbers to their sum
        int sum = numbers.stream()
                        .reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```
In this example:

- We create a list of integers numbers.
- Example 1 demonstrates filtering even numbers using the filter() operation.
- Example 2 shows mapping each number to its square using the map() operation.
- Example 3 illustrates reducing the numbers to their sum using the reduce() operation.
### Features ðŸš€
- Provides a comprehensive understanding of streams in Java.
- Clarifies that streams are not storage containers but rather enable efficient processing of data elements.
- Offers examples of common stream operations including filtering, mapping, and reducing.

## Introduction to Streams Pipeline
Streams Pipeline is a powerful feature introduced in Java 8, allowing developers to perform complex data processing tasks with concise and expressive code.

### What is Streams Pipeline?
Streams Pipeline is a sequence of aggregate operations (such as filter, map, reduce, etc.) that are applied to a stream of elements to perform a specific task. It enables functional-style operations on collections, making code more readable, concise, and efficient.

### Key Concepts ðŸš€
- **Stream :** Represents a sequence of elements and supports aggregate operations.
- **Intermediate Operations :** Operations such as filter, map, sorted, etc., which transform a stream into another stream. These operations are lazy and do not produce any result until a terminal operation is executed.
- **Terminal Operations :** Operations such as forEach, collect, reduce, etc., which produce a result or side-effect. Terminal operations trigger the execution of the intermediate operations.
- **Stateless vs. Stateful Operations :** Stateless operations do not rely on the state of other elements in the stream, whereas stateful operations may depend on the state of other elements.
### Getting Started
To use Streams Pipeline in your Java project:

Ensure you have Java 8 or later installed on your system.
Create a new Java project or open an existing one.
Import the necessary packages:
```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;
```
Start using Streams Pipeline in your code.
### Examples ðŸ’¡
Filtering elements
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Alice", "Bob", "David");
// Filter names starting with 'A'
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);
```
### Mapping elements
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Square each number
numbers.stream()
       .map(n -> n * n)
       .forEach(System.out::println);
```
### Reducing elements
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Sum of all numbers
int sum = numbers.stream()
                 .reduce(0, Integer::sum);
System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
```

## Java Streams `map()` Function

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Alice", "Bob", "Eve");

        // Convert each name to uppercase
        List<String> upperCaseNames = names.stream()
                                          .map(String::toUpperCase)
                                          .collect(Collectors.toList());

        System.out.println(upperCaseNames); // Output: [JOHN, ALICE, BOB, EVE]
    }
}

### Streams in Java: Traversable Only Once
Streams are an integral part of Java since the introduction of Java 8. They provide a powerful and efficient way to process collections of objects. However, one crucial characteristic of streams is that they are **traversable only once**.

### What Does "Traversable Only Once" Mean?

When you create a stream and perform operations on it, such as filtering, mapping, or reducing, the stream processes the elements in a pipeline fashion. Once you have consumed or processed the elements of the stream, the stream cannot be reused. Attempting to iterate over the stream again or perform any terminal operation on it will result in an `IllegalStateException`.

### Why Are Streams Traversable Only Once?

This characteristic is designed to promote efficiency and simplicity in stream processing. By limiting streams to a single traversal, Java can optimize various aspects of stream operations, such as lazy evaluation and reduced memory consumption.

### Best Practices

To avoid unexpected behavior and exceptions when working with streams, it's essential to keep in mind that streams are traversable only once. Here are some best practices:

- **Create streams when needed:** Avoid storing streams in variables if you plan to traverse them multiple times. Instead, recreate the stream when necessary.
- **Perform terminal operations judiciously:** Once you perform a terminal operation (e.g., `forEach`, `collect`, `reduce`), the stream is consumed. Make sure you have processed all necessary operations before calling a terminal operation.
- **Consider intermediate operations:** Intermediate operations (e.g., `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`) do not trigger traversal of the stream. You can chain multiple intermediate operations before invoking a terminal operation.

### Example ðŸ’¡

```java
import java.util.stream.Stream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating a stream
        Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("A", "B", "C");

        // Performing intermediate operations
        stream = stream.filter(s -> !s.equals("B")); // Filtering out "B"
        stream = stream.map(String::toLowerCase);    // Converting elements to lowercase

        // Performing terminal operation
        stream.forEach(System.out::println); // Prints "a" and "c"

        // Attempting to reuse the stream will result in an IllegalStateException
        // stream.forEach(System.out::println); // Throws IllegalStateException
    }
}
```
### Conclusion ðŸŽ‰
Understanding that streams are traversable only once is crucial for effective and efficient stream processing in Java. By adhering to best practices and being mindful of this characteristic, you can leverage the full power of streams while avoiding common pitfalls.

##  Parallel Streams in Java
Parallel streams are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allow for concurrent execution of stream operations. They provide an easy way to parallelize bulk operations on collections, potentially improving performance for computationally intensive tasks.

### What Are Parallel Streams?

In Java, streams are sequences of elements that support various operations to perform computations. Parallel streams leverage the multi-core architecture of modern CPUs by splitting the stream into multiple segments and processing each segment concurrently.

Parallel streams can offer significant performance improvements for certain types of operations, especially when dealing with large datasets and computationally intensive tasks. However, they also come with some considerations and potential pitfalls, such as increased memory consumption and the need for proper synchronization in certain scenarios.

### Example ðŸ’¡

- Let's demonstrate the usage of parallel streams with a simple example:

 -Suppose we have a list of integers and we want to calculate the sum of squares of each element in parallel.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ParallelStreamDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a list of integers
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

        // Calculate the sum of squares using parallel stream
        long sum = Arrays.stream(numbers)
                         .parallel() // Convert stream to parallel stream
                         .mapToLong(x -> x * x) // Calculate square of each element
                         .sum(); // Sum up the squares

        System.out.println("Sum of squares (parallel): " + sum);
    }
}
```
In this example, we convert the array of numbers into a parallel stream using the `parallel()` method. Then, we use the `mapToLong()` operation to calculate the square of each element and `sum()` operation to compute the total sum of squares. The parallel processing capability of the stream allows the computation to be distributed across multiple threads, potentially leading to improved performance.

### Considerations
While parallel streams can offer performance benefits, they are not always the best choice. Here are some considerations to keep in mind:

- **Performance overhead :** Parallelizing stream operations incurs overhead due to thread management and synchronization, which may not always lead to performance gains, especially for small datasets or operations with low computational complexity.
- **Concurrency issues :** Parallel streams introduce concurrency, which can lead to race conditions and other synchronization issues if not used correctly. Proper synchronization mechanisms should be employed when dealing with shared mutable state.
- **Memory consumption :** Parallel streams may consume more memory than sequential streams due to the need to split the stream into segments and maintain intermediate results. This increased memory consumption can impact the performance of the application, especially in memory-constrained environments.
### Conclusion ðŸŽ‰
Parallel streams in Java provide a convenient way to parallelize stream operations and leverage multi-core processors for improved performance. However, they come with considerations such as performance overhead, concurrency issues, and increased memory consumption. By understanding when and how to use parallel streams effectively, developers can harness their power to optimize performance for computationally intensive tasks.
